## Error Analysis

### Distribution of Prediction Errors

| Error Range | Neural Network | Random Forest |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| < 0.5 grade | 18.81% | 19.07% |
| < 1.0 grade | 36.56% | 36.08% |
| < 1.5 grades | 51.37% | 51.72% |
| < 2.0 grades | 65.29% | 63.96% |
| >= 2.0 grades | 34.71% | 36.04% |

## Conclusion

The Neural Network model achieved the best performance with a mean absolute error of 1.8346 grade points. Both models were able to predict grades within 1 grade of the actual value for about 36.1% of test routes and within 2 grades for about 64.0% of test routes.

Both models showed a tendency to overestimate grades, suggesting that there may be subtle factors affecting difficulty perception that aren't fully captured by the features.

### Key Findings

1. **avg_distance** is the most important feature for grade prediction.
2. The models can predict climbing grades with moderate accuracy (within 1 grade 36.1% of the time).
3. Accuracy increases to 64.0% when allowing predictions within 2 grades of the actual value.
4. Both models tend to overestimate route difficulty, with the Neural Network showing less bias.
5. Random Forest provides interpretable results through feature importance analysis.
