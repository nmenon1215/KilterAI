## Visualizations

Key visualizations created:

1. Grade distribution
2. Feature correlations
3. Hold placement patterns
4. Feature distributions by grade
5. PCA analysis of hold positions
6. Benchmark vs. standard route comparisons

## Next Steps

1. Train machine learning models to predict grades
2. Evaluate model performance
3. Analyze feature importance
4. Test model on new routes
